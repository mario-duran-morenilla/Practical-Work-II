## Problems During the Development
During the development of this project, I had some problems.

Sometimes I forgot to save the files before making a commit.
I had difficulties understanding the basic structure of an HTML document.
Some images did not appear because the file names or paths were wrong.
I also had problems configuring GitHub Pages and understanding when changes appear on the website.
I had trouble organizing the content inside the HTML files in a clear way.
Creating the table in the degree page was difficult because I was not familiar with HTML table tags.
I was not sure how to correctly link the fce.html page.


## Conclusions
This project helped me understand how a basic website is done.
I learned how to create web pages using HTML and how to apply styles with CSS.

This practical work was useful to improve my knowledge and confidence in web development.
