  <li>Use of sensors and data to monitor city services</li>
  <li>Efficient energy and resource management</li>
  <li>Improved public transportation systems</li>
  <li>Better communication between citizens and institutions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Areas of Smart Cities</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Smart Mobility:</strong> traffic control, public transport optimization</li>
  <li><strong>Smart Environment:</strong> pollution monitoring and sustainability</li>
  <li><strong>Smart Government:</strong> digital public services</li>
  <li><strong>Smart Living:</strong> health, safety and quality of life</li>
</ul>

<h2>Role of Computer Engineering</h2>

<p>
  Computer engineers play an important role in Smart Cities. They design
  software systems, manage data, develop networks and ensure that technological
  solutions work correctly and securely.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  Smart Cities represent the future of urban development. Thanks to technology
  and innovation, cities can become more sustainable, efficient and adapted
  to the needs of modern society.
